# Class_TwoLayerNN_and_Data_Classification

- The file "Class_TwoLayerNN" contains the class "TwoLayerNN", which consists of the "feedForward" and "backpropagation" methods.
It also consists of the optimizer the method "sgd"

- Under construction : we will build another class called "Optimizers" which will eventually consists SGD, Adam, Mini-batch GD and momentum GD.
 Then the "TwoLayerNN" class will be set to be a child class of the "Optimizers" class.
